# ADB GUI Tool
## What is this?
This is a tool utilizing Python to run ADB commands in a standalone app, instead of the terminal. This is meant for beginners to ADB, but can be used by anyone.
## What commands are currently implemented, and what do they do?
### Scripting
Reboot - Just reboots the phone.
Reboot Recovery - Reboots the phone into recovery.
Reboot Fastboot - Reboots the phone into fastboot.
### Debugging
Logcat - Gives you a constant log of what's happening in the phone. Note that from my experience, there's no way to stop this except for unplugging the phone or closing the app.
